# Fire propagation simulation

A simple JavaScript application that aims to simulate the spread of a forest fire.

I used [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve the html page and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for code testing.

## Quick start ðŸ”¥

Install application dependencies:

```npm
npm install
```

Start server:

```npm
npm run start
```

Test the application:

```npm
npm run test
```

If you want to test the app in CLI:

```node
node app/localmain.js
```

## Things to improve :hammer_and_wrench:

- Setup a build with webpack
- Place the application in a docker container
- Use a modern frontend framework/library (like React, Vue, ...)
- Allow the user to define the fire simulation parameters directly on the interface
